## Overview

Fintola 2.0 is a real-time trading intelligence dashboard that helps active
traders monitor live market movements, evaluate intraday and delivery (positional)
strategies, and generate AI-assisted trade insights. It merges streaming price
data, technical indicator computation, and Gemini-powered narrative analysis to
support more informed decision-making. (Not financial advice.)

## Core Capabilities

### 📈 Live Market Data
- Real-time price streaming for selected equities
- Bid/ask snapshots and last traded price movements
- High/low, % change, volume, VWAP (where available)
- Auto-refresh with throttled WebSocket / SSE handling

### 🧠 AI Insights (Gemini)
- Natural‑language summaries of market context
- Buy / sell inclination with reasoning (risk-weighted)
- Strategy alignment (intraday vs delivery)
- Sentiment & momentum interpretation
- Risk warnings and confidence scoring

### 🧪 Strategy Engine
- Intraday momentum & breakout model
- Delivery (swing / positional) trend confirmation
- Customizable indicator thresholds (e.g. RSI, EMA crossovers)
- Multi-timeframe confluence checks
- Risk/reward and stop-loss suggestion logic

### 📊 Technical Analysis
- Indicator overlays: EMA / SMA stacks, RSI, MACD, VWAP*
- Support / resistance zone detection*
- Candlestick pattern tagging*
- Volume profile & relative volume flags*
- Backtest skeleton for extending strategy validation
(* where implemented or in progress)

### 🔔 Alerts & Signals
- Threshold & crossover triggers
- Strategy alignment signals (enter / watch / exit)
- Risk management prompts (trail / tighten / reduce)
- Debounced notification pipeline to avoid noise

## Architecture

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + React server & client components
- Data Layer: WebSocket / SSE streaming + REST fallbacks
- Backend Services: API routes for symbol lookup, strategy evaluation, AI prompt orchestration
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma (watchlists, user preferences, cached indicator snapshots)
- AI Integration: Gemini API (structured prompts with system + context + constraints)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + utility-driven responsive layout
- State Management: Lightweight client state + server components + SWR/React Query (if used)
- Caching: In-memory + incremental static regeneration (for non-live pages)

## Data Flow

1. User selects / watches symbols
2. Stream handler ingests live ticks (normalized)
3. Indicator & strategy engine computes derived metrics
4. Snapshot persisted (batched) for historical context
5. AI prompt builder composes summary (symbol + indicators + strategy status)
6. Gemini returns structured JSON / text → rendered into UI panels
7. Alerts emitted when rules fire

## Performance & Reliability

- Connection health monitoring & auto-reconnect
- Rate limiting + debounce for AI prompt invocations
- Batched DB writes to reduce churn
- Lazy loading heavy analysis panels
- Memoized indicator computations per symbol frame

## Security & Compliance

- Environment-isolated API keys
- Input sanitization for AI prompt context
- Least-privilege DB access via Prisma schema scoping
- No PII storage (only user config + watchlists)

## Challenges & Solutions

### Real-time Stability
Managed reconnect storms with exponential backoff and sequence gap reconciliation.

### Indicator Computation Load
Introduced caching layers and incremental recalculation (only on new ticks).

### AI Hallucination Mitigation
Used structured prompts + explicit constraints + confidence extraction parsing.

### Strategy Interpretability
Displayed raw indicator values alongside AI narrative for user trust.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full backtesting module with equity curve
- [ ] Multi-broker order placement integration
- [ ] Options chain analytics
- [ ] Portfolio risk aggregation
- [ ] Mobile-optimized condensed layout
- [ ] More advanced ML-based anomaly detection

## Lessons Learned

Building Fintola 2.0 reinforced the importance of:
- Clear separation between raw market data and derived analytics
- Guardrails for AI output (never execute trades automatically)
- Performance budgeting for streaming UIs
- Transparent strategy logic to build user confidence

Not financial advice. Users should verify signals independently.
