## Project Vision

The SVG Images API Service provides a simple yet powerful solution for managing
SVG images across different projects. This lightweight API service enables
developers to easily upload, fetch, and manage SVG files with proper validation
and CORS support, making it perfect for icon management and dynamic image
serving.

## Key Features

### üì§ Image Upload System

- SVG file upload via REST API
- File size validation (5MB maximum)
- SVG format validation
- Automatic timestamp-based naming to prevent conflicts
- Secure file handling with proper error responses

### üìã Image Management

- List all uploaded SVG images
- Get detailed information about specific images
- Delete images when no longer needed
- Direct URL access for easy integration

### üåê Cross-Origin Support

- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Easy integration with any frontend framework
- Direct image serving for HTML `<img>` tags
- RESTful API design for consistent usage

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

The service provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for image management:

```javascript
// Upload endpoint
app.post('/upload', upload.single('image'), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'No file uploaded'
    })
  }

  const fileInfo = {
    filename: req.file.filename,
    originalName: req.file.originalname,
    size: req.file.size,
    url: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/images/${req.file.filename}`,
    directUrl: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/images/${req.file.filename}`
  }

  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'SVG image uploaded successfully',
    data: fileInfo
  })
})
```

### Server Architecture

- **Express.js Backend**: Lightweight and fast server setup
- **Multer Integration**: Efficient file upload handling
- **File System Storage**: Local storage with organized file structure
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin resource sharing enabled
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and validation

### Frontend Integration Examples

The API can be easily integrated into any project:

**HTML Usage:**

```html
<img
  src="https://ccimageapi.netlify.app/images/your-filename.svg"
  alt="Icon"
  width="32"
  height="32"
/>

<!-- Theme-based usage -->
<img
  src="https://ccimageapi.netlify.app/images/tech-stack-typescript-light.svg"
  alt="TypeScript light icon"
  className="hidden [html.light_&]:block"
/>
```

**JavaScript/React Integration:**

```javascript
// Fetch available images
const fetchImages = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://ccimageapi.netlify.app/images/list')
  const data = await response.json()
  return data.images
}

// React component
function TechIcon({ technology, theme = 'light' }) {
  const imageUrl = `https://ccimageapi.netlify.app/images/tech-stack-${technology}-${theme}.svg`

  return (
    <img
      src={imageUrl}
      alt={`${technology} ${theme} icon`}
      width={32}
      height={32}
    />
  )
}
```

## API Documentation
