## Project Overview

OEM Vulnerability Scanner is a comprehensive AI‑assisted security monitoring platform that aggregates critical vulnerabilities from 10+ OEM and authoritative sources, performs automated enrichment, prioritization, mitigation planning, and delivers real-time notifications with role‑aware reporting.

## Supported Sources

- NVD (API)
- CISA KEV Catalog
- Microsoft Security Response Center
- Cisco Security Advisories
- Google Cloud Security Bulletins
- Oracle Security Alerts
- VMware Security Advisories
- IBM Security Bulletins
- Adobe Security Bulletins
- HPE Security Bulletins

## Core Features

### 🔍 Multi-Source Collection
- Parallel ingestion of 10+ OEM feeds
- Automated de-duplication (by CVE)
- Incremental discovery with timestamp tracking

### 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- Plain-language vulnerability summaries
- Technical + business impact assessment
- Exploitability / attack vector evaluation
- Context-aware prioritization (1–10)
- Automated mitigation & remediation strategy
- Audience-specific (Engineer / Exec / Compliance) reports
- Enhanced threat intelligence enrichment

### ⚙️ Smart Prioritization
- Severity + exploit status + publication recency
- Organizational context weighting (extensible)
- Risk scoring rationale and remediation timeframe

### 📥 Data Management
- SQLite storage with uniqueness on CVE
- Timestamped discovery + notification flags
- CSV export (global or filtered)

### 📊 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- Real-time vulnerability feed
- Severity, OEM, date-range filtering
- Trend charts, distributions, heatmaps
- AI enrichment panel
- On-demand CSV export

### 📧 Email Notification System
- Automated alerts for Critical / High
- HTML formatted content + optional AI insights
- Multiple managed recipients
- CSV attachment option
- Test notification workflow

### 🧠 Mitigation Planning
- Immediate actions
- Long-term remediation steps
- Compensating controls
- Resource estimation
- Verification procedures

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Python 3.8+
- Data: SQLite
- AI: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Scraping: Playwright (JS-required), BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Visualization: Plotly
- Email: SMTP (HTML)

## Architecture Overview

1. Source Registry (OEM_SOURCES) defines extraction strategy
2. Scraper Orchestrator runs selected sources (Playwright where needed)
3. Normalization layer maps raw fields → unified schema
4. AI Enrichment pipeline (optional / cached)
5. Persistence layer (SQLite) with de-duplication on CVE
6. Notification dispatcher (severity + state aware)
7. Streamlit UI queries + visualizes + exports
8. CLI entry point for headless automation / cron
