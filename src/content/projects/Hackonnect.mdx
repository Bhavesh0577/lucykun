## Project Overview

HackFlow is an intelligent co-pilot for hackathons. It streamlines the entire lifecycle: discovering relevant hackathons, generating and refining ideas, visualizing project flows, assembling teams, collaborating live, and gathering AI-curated resources—reducing friction and accelerating innovation.

## Inspiration

Common pain points:
- Idea paralysis
- Noisy hackathon discovery
- Team formation friction
- Unstructured planning
- Hard-to-find APIs/datasets
- Lack of competitive insight

HackFlow solves these with focused AI assistance and collaborative tooling.

## Core Features

### 🚀 AI Hackathon Finder
- Uses Perplexity (sonar-pro) to fetch and rank hackathons (Devpost, Devfolio, DoraHacks, etc.)
- Personalized by interests, themes, tech focus

### 💡 AI Idea Generator
- Deep research (sonar-deep-research) to expand prompts into:
  - Problem framing
  - Use cases
  - Feature sets
  - Suggested stacks

### 🗺 Project Flowchart Generator
- Transforms ideas into interactive flow diagrams via React Flow
- Modules, dependencies, data flow

### 🛠 AI Resource Hub
- Curated APIs, datasets, tools, learning links
- Structured JSON responses for consistent rendering

### 🔍 Competitive Analysis (Concept / Partial)
- Planned: Compare against past winners for uniqueness and impact

### 👥 Team Collaboration
- Team profiles (skills, roles, availability)
- Real-time chat (Socket.IO)
- Skill- & interest-based teammate discovery (roadmap)

### 🔐 Authentication
- Clerk for secure session + user management

### 🔄 Real-Time
- Socket.IO channel per team for chat & presence

### 📊 Sustainability / Impact (Planned Extension)
- Future scoring for environmental and social impact

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
- Tailwind + Shadcn UI
- Client + Server Components composition
- React Flow for diagramming

### Backend / API
- Next.js API Routes (serverless)
- AI orchestration layer wrapping Perplexity endpoints
- Structured prompt templates + response validators

### AI Integration
- Perplexity API:
  - sonar-pro: listing + resources
  - sonar-deep-research: idea expansion
- (Pluggable design for future models)

### Data Layer
- NeonDB (Serverless PostgreSQL)
- Prisma (type-safe queries, migrations)
- Models: Idea, TeamMessage, TeamProfile (+ extensible)

### Realtime Layer
- Socket.IO namespace per team
- Graceful reconnect + broadcast

### Auth
- Clerk JWT session
- Middleware guards on protected routes
